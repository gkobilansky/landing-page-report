## üéØ High-Impact Improvements for User Value

### 1. **Enhanced Competitive Context & Benchmarking**
- **Current Gap**: Users get scores but don't know how they compare to industry standards
- **Suggestion**: 
  - Add industry-specific benchmarks (e.g., "Your CTA score of 65 is below the SaaS average of 78")
  - Create percentile rankings ("Your page loads faster than 72% of e-commerce sites")
  - Add competitor comparison capability (analyze 3-5 competitor URLs for side-by-side comparison)
  - Store anonymized data to build your own benchmark database over time

### 2. **Actionable Visual Evidence**
- **Current Gap**: Text-based issues lack visual context
- **Suggestion**:
  - Capture and annotate screenshots highlighting specific issues
  - Create visual overlays showing CTA placement, whitespace distribution, and social proof locations
  - Add before/after mockups for key recommendations
  - Include heat map visualizations for element density and attention flow

### 3. **Prioritized Action Plan Generator**
- **Current Gap**: Users get many recommendations but unclear where to start
- **Suggestion**:
  - Create a "Quick Wins" section with 3-5 highest-impact, easiest-to-implement changes
  - Estimate implementation time and conversion impact for each recommendation
  - Generate a phased improvement roadmap
  - Add "one-click fixes" for simple issues (e.g., meta description templates)
